The Architecture depending part of the scheduler should at least implement the
follwing functions:

	/**
	 * This Function does the context switch between to processes. The Paramters
	 * does not have to be of type process_type they could be of any type
	 * process in inherited from.
	 */
void switch_to( process_type& prev, process_type& next );

	/**
	 * This function should prepare a process for running. It should start it's
	 * execusion with calling fct_ptr and the other parameters. Note that you
	 * have to proviede the typedef for start_function but it should be
	 *	void foo( int num, void* data ); //int depends on hardware 32/64
	 */
void prepare( process_type& process, start_function fct_ptr );
