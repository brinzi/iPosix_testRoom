A timer, used only by the x86_kernel by default, has to implement the
following functions:

void wait( const uint64_t ticks ) const;
uint64_t get_ticks() const;

const is currently optional, but isn't maybe in the future

The timer also has to inherit from ::iposix::utils::Singleton< Timerclass >
(see src/kern/lib/utils/singleton.hpp) and should therefor designed to be used
as singleton.


Please notice: this description is just needed for a timer policy class for
the x86_kernel. Any other kernel, also another x86 kernel, may have another
policy requirements for timers.
