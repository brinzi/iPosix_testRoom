This folder contains configuration includes. In the main folder include/config
should be some header files which should be included by the coresponding header.
The main folder also contains a folder for every architecture with architecture
depending configuration files.

Architecture independent:
	If you write a component which is architecture independent you should write a
	config file in the main folder which makes a define and includes the
	component.

For example:
	The scheduling stragtegie:
		There are serveral possiblities how to schedule processes but you would never
		change the used strategie during runtime. So you write a config header
		with a define SCHEDULER_STRATEGIE to your strategie:
		#define SCHEDULER_STRATEGIE ::iposix::scheduler::policies::my_strategie
		and an include for that file
		#include "scheduler/policies/my_strategie.h"
		this file should be include by i_scheduler.h
		#include "config/config_scheduler.h"

Architecture dependent:
	IF you write a component which is architecture dependent you should write a
	config file in the main folder and a config file in the architecture folder.
	The file in the main folder should decide depending on the compiled
	architecture which architecture config file should be included.

For example:
	The scheduler itself:
		Because how to change the current running process is architecture
		dependent you write the config file in the main folder:
		#pragma once
		#include "config/config.h"		//change the architecture in this 
										//configfile
		#ifdef _IPOSIX_ARCHITECTURE_NAME_
		#	include "config/x86/config_scheduler.h"
		//other architectures are following
		#endif
		And in the architecture folder:
		#pragma once
		#define ARCH_SCHEDULER ::iposix::arch::x86::scheduler
		#include "x86/scheduler/scheduler.h"
